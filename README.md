# Quiz

## Description
I made a quiz about dogs and cats. Little games like these are fun ways to learn how to code, and they can be good examples to show your friends and family what you're learning how to do. I tried to have some questions that are not immediately obvious to give a little challenge. If I had more time, I would've figured out how to have the ranking screen show more scores that have been saved.

I learned a lot about how computers think and how important the order of functions is in the code. Plus, I was able to solidfy some skills in jQuery.
